This code solves and plots the distribution for an electron hole

It should compile on any linux box with gfortran and C compilers,
provided the X11 development packages are installed.
	 $ make

A version can be compiled with JUST gfortran by
  	 $ make noX
which will not give graphics output except with Xterm and even that's messy.
But it will create the graphics output files.

Run by
	$ ./BGKint
Just hit return to progress through the plots.
